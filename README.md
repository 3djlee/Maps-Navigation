# Maps and Navigation Project

Welcome to the Maps and Navigation project, a fun project that navigates between user-inputted roads across multiple islands. By integrating Dijkstra algorithm, this project offers a solution for an optimized route planning while considering traffic conditions.

## Features

- **Road Input:** Users can input roads and their connections between various islands.
- **Route Planning:** The system calculates the shortest distance between two points based on user input and road connections.
- **Traffic Consideration:** Traffic conditions are taken into account during route planning to optimize travel time.
- **Multiple Islands:** Navigation is supported across multiple islands, offering seamless travel between different locations.
- **Interactive Interface:** Users can interact with an intuitive interface to input roads, view routes, and receive navigation instructions.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** [C]
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra algorithm for calculating shortest paths

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to allow personalized route planning and saving of favorite locations.
- **Alternate Route Suggestions:** Offer alternate route suggestions to users based on factors such as road closures or accidents.
